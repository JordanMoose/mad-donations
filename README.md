# MAD-Donations

MAD-Donations is a proof-of-concept subscription donation platform built to explore recurring payment workflows and full-stack architecture. It provides a web interface for setting up and managing recurring donations.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Python + Flask**
- **REST API** for managing users, campaigns, and recurring donations

### Web
- **JavaScript** (with **SCSS/CSS** for styling)
- Responsive frontend for browsing campaigns and managing subscriptions

## Features

- Create and manage recurring donation subscriptions.
- View active campaigns and contribution history.
- Simple user authentication and input validation.

## Status

This project was built as an early full-stack experiment to explore:
- Designing APIs that support multiple clients  
- Modeling recurring payment workflows  
- Structuring a monorepo with separate `backend`, `mobile`, and `website` folders  

The mobile client was planned but not implemented.  
The project is no longer actively maintained.
